Handling Missing values in the datasets
Handling missing values is one of the essential step in data analysis. First we need to check for the missing values.
Work is done on the datasets named 'Netflix title' which contains the shows of netflix and their relative information. There were missing values in the director, cast, country, date_added column which were dropped from the dataframe using dropna() function.
Dates were changed to standard format and datatypes were checked.
